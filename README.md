## SH Escape

This is a fork of the original [shescape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shescape) on NPM. This fork has been modified to allow for Node v19+. The benchmarks, tests, and other dev-related files have been removed, putting the entire focus on source code, and making it easier to keep this repo in sync with upstream changes. Build files have also been removed, and therefore it's necessary to pull in the the compiled `./index.cjs` file from the upstream package.
